# `cursor-review.yml` — label-triggered multi-model code review

Read [the shared caller contract](README.md) first.

## What it does

A 4-lab × 2-review-type `cursor-agent` panel runs adversarial and edge-case
passes over the PR diff. A judge model consolidates them into **one** PR review
with per-finding severity badges. The person who applied the label gets Slack
start/complete DMs.

**Advisory only.** No input fails the run on findings — the panel posts the review
and succeeds regardless of what it found. If you want a merge gate, mark the
consolidate check required: it is named `<your caller's job id> / Consolidate panel`
(so `review / Consolidate panel` for the caller below). That gates on a review
having *run*, not on its findings being addressed — resolving them stays a human
judgement call.

Prompts and scripts live in [`.github/cursor-review/`](../../.github/cursor-review)
— the single source of truth, so your repo carries only a thin caller.

## Prerequisites

| | |
|---|---|
| `secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY` | **Required.** Org-level in Comfy-Org. |
| `secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Optional. Without it the review still posts; only the DMs are skipped. |
| `vars.REVIEW_BOT_APP_ID` + `secrets.BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Optional. Posts the review as your App instead of `github-actions[bot]`. |
| A review label | Default `cursor-review`. Create it in your repo. |

## Caller

`.github/workflows/cursor-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: Cursor Review

on:
  pull_request:
    # Label-gated mode. If you set `run_without_label: true` below, this list
    # must also carry [opened, reopened, ready_for_review, synchronize] — see
    # the gotcha at the bottom.
    types: [labeled, unlabeled]

concurrency:
  # cursor-review declares no group of its own, so a caller-level group is safe
  # and worth having — it stops label-toggling from stacking panels.
  group: cursor-review-pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.event.label.name }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  review:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    uses: Comfy-Org/github-workflows/.github/workflows/cursor-review.yml@<full-commit-sha>
    with:
      workflows_ref: <same-full-commit-sha>
      bot_app_id: ${{ vars.REVIEW_BOT_APP_ID }}
    secrets:
      CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
      SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
      BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Then add your repo to `vars.CURSOR_REVIEW_CALLERS`.

## Required permissions

```yaml
contents: read
pull-requests: write   # posting the consolidated review
```

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `judge_model` | `claude-opus-4-8-thinking-max` | Consolidates the panel into one review. |
| `diff_size_cap` | `5000` | Skip review above this diff size. |
| `review_label` | `cursor-review` | The label that triggers a run. |
| `diff_excludes` | lockfiles, `node_modules`, `.claude`, `dist`, `vendor`, `*.generated.*`, `*.min.js` | Paths kept out of **both** the size-budget count and the reviewed diff. Passing your own value **replaces** the default list, so re-state the entries you still want. |
| `workflows_ref` | `main` | **Set to your `uses:` SHA** — prompts load from this ref at run time. |
| `bot_app_id` | `''` | Post as your App. |
| `run_without_label` | `false` | Run on every PR rather than waiting for the label. **Also requires widening your caller's `types:`** — see the gotcha. |

## Gotchas

**The label must be applied by a GitHub App token, not `GITHUB_TOKEN`.** Events
raised by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger workflow runs, so a label applied by
another workflow using the default token silently fails to start a review. That
is exactly what [`cursor-review-auto-label.yml`](cursor-review-auto-label.md)
exists to handle.

**Applying the label does not guarantee a run.** If the event was swallowed,
remove the label, confirm it is gone, then re-add it.

**One review per commit — re-labeling alone will not re-review.** The gate skips
the panel if a non-dismissed consolidated review already exists for the PR's HEAD
SHA, so a remove-and-re-add on unchanged content no-ops by design. To get a fresh
review of the same commit, **dismiss the existing review first**, then apply the
label. Pushing a commit changes the SHA and always re-runs.

**Fork PRs are skipped, deliberately.** `pull_request` withholds secrets from
fork-originated runs, so `CURSOR_API_KEY` would be empty (every panel cell
produces nothing) and `GITHUB_TOKEN` read-only (posting the review 403s). The gate
detects the cross-repo head and skips cleanly rather than burning the matrix and
failing red on every external contribution. Do not "fix" this with
`pull_request_target` — that runs privileged against untrusted head code.

**`run_without_label: true` needs a wider trigger, or it never fires.** The input
only tells the reusable's gate to accept `opened` / `reopened` /
`ready_for_review` / `synchronize`; it cannot add those events to *your* `on:`
block. A caller left on `types: [labeled, unlabeled]` therefore still runs only
when a label is toggled — ordinary PRs are silently never reviewed, with nothing
in any log to explain it. Set both together:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, ready_for_review, synchronize, labeled, unlabeled]
# ...
    with:
      run_without_label: true
```

Keep `labeled`/`unlabeled` in the list even in label-free mode: the label path
stays live alongside it, which is how you force a re-review on an unchanged commit
(dismiss the existing review, then apply the label — see the dedupe gotcha below).

**`run_without_label: true` reviews every PR.** On a busy repo that is a large
step up in spend. Start label-gated.
