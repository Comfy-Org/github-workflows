# Contract test: every bump-*-callers.yml entrypoint's `paths:` filter must match
# the WATCHED / WATCHED_ASSETS it hands preflight.sh, EXACTLY.
#
# Why this exists. preflight.sh's re-point (pin callers to the verified main tip
# rather than to this run's github.sha) is only sound when the surface it
# compared covers every entry in the fleet's trigger filter — see the COUPLED TO
# THE PATH FILTER note there. Both directions of a mismatch are silent and both
# are bad:
#
#   * inputs NARROWER than the filter → the re-point pins callers to a tip whose
#     other filtered content was never compared;
#   * inputs WIDER than the filter → a commit touching only the extra path
#     starts no run of its own but does change the compared tree, so this run
#     skips green as a "stale re-run" waiting on a run that will never exist,
#     freezing the fleet.
#
# Until this test, the only guard on those seven hand-written pairs was a
# checklist line in the README: test_preflight.sh drives synthetic fixtures and
# never reads the entrypoints. This reads the real files.
#
# The parser is deliberately strict — a file whose shape it cannot read FAILS
# rather than passing silently, because a contract test that quietly matches
# nothing is worse than no test at all.

# A `KEY: value` from inside the Preflight step block only — so an identically
# named env on some other step cannot answer for it.
#
# Two shapes are accepted, and the output is the same either way: one entry per
# line, so a caller splits on newlines regardless.
#
#   KEY: value          → one line
#   KEY: |              → a LITERAL BLOCK SCALAR: every following line indented
#     a                   deeper than the key, until the indentation returns.
#     b                   This is how a multi-asset fleet spells WATCHED_ASSETS.
#
# `KEY:` with nothing after it and no indented block yields nothing — the caller
# treats that as unparsed and fails, which is the point: a shape this cannot read
# must never pass silently (a contract test that quietly matches nothing is worse
# than no test at all). Anything else — including a FOLDED `>` scalar — falls
# through as a plain value and mismatches loudly against the `paths:` filter.
#
# ONLY `|` IS A BLOCK INDICATOR HERE, and its modifier is at most one chomping
# indicator plus one 1-9 indentation digit, because both looser spellings would
# make this test certify a config the runtime reads DIFFERENTLY:
#
#   * `>` folds its lines into ONE space-joined string, so preflight.sh receives
#     `.github/cursor-review scripts/check-pr-size` as a single entry that
#     resolves to nothing (a silent proceed=false that freezes the fleet) while
#     splitting on newlines here would show two correct entries and pass.
#   * `|0` / `|++` / `|12` are not valid block headers at all, so GitHub cannot
#     parse the workflow — worse than a mis-comparison, and certifiable under a
#     `[0-9+-]*` modifier pattern.
#
# Block CONTENT is taken literally, `#` lines included: a YAML block scalar has
# no comment syntax, so such a line really is a watched path as far as
# preflight.sh is concerned (where validate_path rejects it with an ::error::).
# Stripping it here would hide that shape behind a green contract test.
